# Introduction
 
Welcome to the documentation for the Ethereum Reality Service!

## What is the Ethereum Reality Service?

The Ethereum Reality Service is a set of smart contracts that enables decentralized authentication, claims, and redirection for secure chips.
Chip provenance can be tracked through the lifecycle of the protocol, from manufacturer enrollment, to brand / creator distribution, to end user authentication.
Additionally, brands and creators can attach unique experiences to their chips, which can be accessed in a decentralized manner by end users, thus reducing the reliance
on centralized services for authentication and experience delivery and putting more control in the end user's hands.
