# Introduction
 
Welcome to the documentation for the Ethereum Reality Service!

## What is the Ethereum Reality Service?

The Ethereum Reality Service is a set of smart contracts that enables decentralized authentication, claims, and redirection for secure chips.
Chip provenance can be tracked through the lifecycle of the protocol, from manufacturer enrollment, to brand / creator distribution, to end user authentication.
Additionally, brands and creators can attach unique experiences to their chips, which can be accessed in a decentralized manner by end users, thus reducing the reliance
on centralized services for authentication and experience delivery and putting more control in the end user's hands.

## Getting Started

Ready to add chips to ERS? The [Scripts section](scripts/intro.md) provides step-by-step guides and command-line tools to:

- Set up your development environment  
- Claim a developer name in the .ers namespace
- Create services and projects
- Enroll chips and bind them to your applications

Start with the [Scripts Setup Guide](scripts/setup.md) to begin adding chips to the ERS protocol.
