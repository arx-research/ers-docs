# Introduction

The Ethereum Reality Service is a network of smart contracts that authenticate and resolve experiences against real world items anchored with secure element chips. 

Practically, this means that 

1. Brands can prove provenance of their goods onchain.
2. Developers can direct attested NFC chips to novel dapps.
3. Creators can immutably link physical art without centralized dependencies.
4. End users are able to track and verify the custody history of their product.

ERS leverages a combination of attestations, a namespace and binding enrollments to achieve these properties for users. ERS is comprised of `Manufacturers` who enroll chips and `Developers` who create `Projects`.

ERS is deployed on Base and Sepolia for testing.
