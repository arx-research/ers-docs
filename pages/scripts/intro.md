# Introduction
This section covers how to interact with the ERS system using the [ERS Scripts Repo](https://github.com/arx-research/ers-scripts). These scripts enable the following functionality:
- Claiming a Developer Name
- Deploying a Developer Project Registrar
- Creating a Service
- Creating a Project
- Transferring Ownership of a Chip

Additional these scripts can be used locally to create and simulate manufacturers and manufacturer enrollments.

Before using this repo it is suggested to review the [Overview](../overview/intro.md) of the ERS protocol.
