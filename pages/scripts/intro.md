# Introduction
This section covers how to interact with the ERS system using the [ERS Scripts Repo](https://github.com/arx-research/ers-scripts). These scripts enable the following functionality:
- Creating a [Service](../solidity-api/ServicesRegistry.md#createservice)
- Creating a Project (via Arx Playground)
- Claiming a Chip

Before using this repo it is suggested to review the [Overview](../overview/intro.md) of the ERS protocol.
